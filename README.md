# enshadowCHAT

enshadowCHAT is a 2x2,  2x2 chatbot answer generation matrix, that conditions the worst response, into a high temp stream of unconscious. enshadowCHAT is a unique Python-based conversational AI framework, featuring an ensemble of language models and incorporating a 'shadow' methodology to generate holistic summaries from given prompts. This project leans on the power of GPT-3 and Sentence Transformers to understand and explore prompts deeply and from various perspectives. Emulating how a nn trains data, this framework conditions responses using temperature variance. 

## Key Features

**Ensemble of Chatbots:** Utilizes an ensemble-like grid of GPT-3 instances, each independently generating responses to a given prompt. The ensemble mechanism improves response diversity and robustness.

**Shadow Methodology:** Incorporates a 'shadow' response mechanism which probes the more profound, unconscious level interpretations of prompts, thus providing a multidimensional understanding.

**Holistic Summarization:** Ranks the responses from chatbots and creates a holistic summary of the best and the shadow responses.

**Semantic Similarity:** Uses Sentence Transformers to rank responses based on semantic similarity to the prompt.

**Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes sentiment analysis to tune the response temperature for subsequent prompts.
